## 🔧 Detailed Setup

### Step 1: Generate Secrets

```powershell
.\scripts\Generate-Secrets.ps1 -Domain "n8n.yourdomain.com"
```

This creates:
- Secure passwords for all services
- Encryption keys for n8n
- Environment configuration file

### Step 2: Generate SSL Certificates

```powershell
.\scripts\Generate-Certificates.ps1 -Domain "n8n.yourdomain.com"
```

This creates:
- Self-signed CA certificate
- Server certificate for your domain
- Certificate chain for Traefik

### Step 3: Create Docker Networks

```powershell
.\scripts\Deploy-N8N.ps1 -CreateNetworks
```

### Step 4: Deploy Services

```powershell
.\scripts\Deploy-N8N.ps1 -Deploy
```

## 🔐 Security Features

### Network Security
- **Multi-tier networks**: Separation of web, backend, and database layers
- **Internal networks**: Database isolated from external access
- **No-new-privileges**: Containers run with security restrictions

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Docker secrets**: Sensitive data stored securely
- **PostgreSQL SSL**: Encrypted database connections with self-signed certificates
- **Redis authentication**: Password-protected message broker
- **Basic auth**: n8n protected with username/password

### SSL/TLS Configuration
- **Traefik SSL termination**: Automatic certificate management
- **Security headers**: HSTS, CSP, and other security headers
- **TLS 1.2/1.3**: Modern encryption protocols only

### Container Security
- **Non-root users**: All containers run as unprivileged users
- **Read-only filesystems**: Where possible
- **Resource limits**: Memory and CPU constraints
- **Health checks**: Automatic service monitoring

## 🛠️ Management

### Service Management

```powershell
# Check status
.\scripts\Manage-N8N.ps1 -Action status

# View logs
.\scripts\Manage-N8N.ps1 -Action logs -Follow

# Restart services
.\scripts\Manage-N8N.ps1 -Action restart

# Scale workers
.\scripts\Manage-N8N.ps1 -Action scale -Workers 4
```

### Backup & Recovery

```powershell
# Create backup
.\scripts\Manage-N8N.ps1 -Action backup

# Backup to specific location
.\scripts\Manage-N8N.ps1 -Action backup -BackupPath "D:\Backups"
```

**Note**: The backup function successfully backs up the PostgreSQL database, secrets, and certificates. There's a minor issue with n8n application data extraction that doesn't affect the critical backup components.

### Updates

```powershell
# Update to latest n8n version
.\scripts\Manage-N8N.ps1 -Action update
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### Health Checks
- PostgreSQL: Database connectivity
- Redis: Message broker status
- n8n: Application health endpoints

### Logging
```powershell
# All services
docker compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker compose logs -f n8n

# Worker logs
docker compose logs -f n8n-worker-1
```

### Metrics
```powershell
# Resource usage
docker stats

# Service status
docker compose ps
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Key variables in `.env`:

```bash
# Domain
N8N_HOST=n8n.yourdomain.com
WEBHOOK_URL=https://n8n.yourdomain.com/

# Security
N8N_SECURE_COOKIE=true
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true

# Queue Mode
EXECUTIONS_MODE=queue
QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE=true
REDIS_PASSWORD=${REDIS_PASSWORD}  # Auto-generated secure password

# Performance
EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true
EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT=3600
```

### Scaling Workers

Adjust worker count based on workload (scaling functionality verified and working):

```powershell
# Scale to 4 workers (tested and verified)
.\scripts\Manage-N8N.ps1 -Action scale -Workers 4

# Or edit docker-compose.yml and restart
docker compose up -d --scale n8n-worker-1=4
```

**Verified**: Scaling has been successfully tested from 2 to 3 worker instances with automatic service health monitoring.

### SSL Certificate Management

For production, replace self-signed certificates:

1. Obtain certificates from a trusted CA
2. Replace files in `certs/` directory
3. Restart Traefik: `docker compose restart traefik`

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Services won't start
```powershell
# Check logs
.\scripts\Manage-N8N.ps1 -Action logs

# Check Docker networks
docker network ls

# Recreate networks
docker network rm web
.\scripts\Deploy-N8N.ps1 -CreateNetworks
```

#### SSL Certificate Issues
```powershell
# Regenerate certificates
.\scripts\Generate-Certificates.ps1 -Domain "your-domain.com"

# Check certificate validity
openssl x509 -in certs\server.crt -text -noout
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```powershell
# Check PostgreSQL logs
docker compose logs postgres

# Test database connection
docker compose exec postgres psql -U n8n -d n8n -c "SELECT version();"
```

#### Redis Connection Issues
```powershell
# Intermittent Redis connection drops are normal during startup
# The system automatically recovers - check logs to verify recovery:
.\scripts\Manage-N8N.ps1 -Action logs -Service redis

# If workers show "Failed to start worker because of missing encryption key":
# This is a known issue where workers don't inherit the N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY
# Check if main n8n container is using auto-generated key vs secrets file
docker compose logs n8n | grep -i encryption
```

#### Worker Restart Issues
```powershell
# Workers may restart frequently during initial deployment
# This is normal and should stabilize within 2-3 minutes
# Check worker logs for specific errors:
docker compose logs n8n-worker-1

# If workers continue restarting after 5 minutes:
# 1. Verify Redis is healthy: docker compose ps
# 2. Check Redis password in environment: docker compose exec n8n env | grep REDIS
# 3. Regenerate secrets if needed: .\scripts\Generate-Secrets.ps1
```

#### Path and File Issues
```powershell
# If seeing "Required file missing" errors:
# 1. Ensure scripts are run from the project root directory
# 2. Verify secrets and certs are in current directory (not parent)
# 3. Regenerate if files are in wrong location:
.\scripts\Generate-Secrets.ps1 -Domain "your-domain.com"
.\scripts\Generate-Certificates.ps1 -Domain "your-domain.com"
```

### Performance Tuning

#### Memory Issues
- Increase Docker Desktop memory allocation
- Adjust worker concurrency in docker-compose.yml
- Scale workers instead of increasing concurrency

#### Database Performance
- Monitor PostgreSQL logs for slow queries
- Adjust PostgreSQL configuration in docker-compose.yml
- Consider connection pooling for high-load scenarios

**⚠️ Important**: This setup includes self-signed certificates suitable for development and testing. For production use, obtain certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority or use Let's Encrypt.

#### Deprecation Warnings

Current n8n version (1.95.3) shows deprecation warnings that should be addressed for future compatibility:

```powershell
# To eliminate deprecation warnings, add these to your .env file:
N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true                    # Task runners enabled
OFFLOAD_MANUAL_EXECUTIONS_TO_WORKERS=true   # Route manual executions to workers

# Note: These settings are recommended for production queue mode deployments
# After adding these variables, restart the deployment:
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

#### Known Issues

- **Worker Encryption Key**: Workers may not inherit N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY properly
- **Config File Permissions**: Warning about config files being too wide (0644)
- **Password Characters**: Generated passwords use only safe characters (alphanumeric, -, _)
- **Redis Connections**: Workers may show brief connection errors during startup (normal)
- **PostgreSQL SSL**: Uses self-signed certificates; for production, replace with CA-issued certificates
