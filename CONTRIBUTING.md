### üîí Repository Protection

This repository uses **GitHub Rulesets** to enforce read-only access:

- **Main Branch Lockdown**: Prevents all direct pushes and requires reviews
- **All Branches Protection**: Blocks force pushes and deletions across all branches
- **Automated Closure**: GitHub Actions automatically close issues and PRs with helpful guidance
- **Transparent Rules**: All users can view active rulesets (Settings ‚Üí Rules ‚Üí Rulesets)

These modern rulesets provide layered protection while maintaining full transparency about repository restrictions.
